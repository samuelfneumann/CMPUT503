# Description

The code in this directory is my attempt to complete
[this](https://docs.duckietown.org/daffy/duckietown-classical-robotics/out/cra_apriltag_augmented_reality_exercise.html).

So far, this implementation is **incomplete**, and I'll probably never complete
it because ~~it's useless for my research and probably is going to take an
insane amount of time and is not direcly applicable to the lab since we don't
need to superimpose anything on the apriltags...~~.

You might want to reference
[this](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d9/dab/tutorial_homography.html) if you ever
do attempt to complete this part.
