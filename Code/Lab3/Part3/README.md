# Part 3

In Part 3 of Lab 3, we implement localization using sensor fusion. When the
Duckiebot sees an apriltag, it updates its location based on the known location
of the apriltag. When no apriltag is in sight, the Duckiebot uses odometry for
localization.

Part 3 of Lab 3 (the code in this directory) is taken and adapted from
[dt-core](https://github.com/duckietown/dt-core).
